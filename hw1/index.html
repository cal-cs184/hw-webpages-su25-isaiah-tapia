		<h2 >Overview</h2>
<!--		Give a high-level overview of what you implemented in this homework. Think about what you've built as a whole. Share your thoughts on what interesting things you've learned from completing the homework.-->
			This project started off with implementing a triangle rasterizer. From understanding that basic building block of graphics I built features like antialiasing
			using supersamples, texture mapping, and textured level mapping using mipmaps. Interspersed between these larger features I learned about barycentric coordinates and implementing matrix
			transformations. Prior to this I had never really given much thought to how amazing it is that we have such high-fidelity
			graphics in our day-to-day lives, but decades have preceded these amazing features, it was interesting to implement foundational aspects of graphics!

		<h2>Task 1: Drawing Single-Color Triangles</h2>
			I found the minimum bounding box of the triangle by finding both the maximum x and y values as well as their min
			a critical part of this was calling the floor / ceiling functions on each coordinate. That way the bounding box would be as close to the
			triangle as possible while still being easily iterable due to its now gridded nature.
			<pre>
for (float x = min_x+0.5;x < max_x ; x++) {
	for (float y = min_y + 0.5; y < max_y; y++) {
		bool a = -(x-x0)*(y1-y0)+(y-y0)*(x1-x0) >= 0;
		bool b = -(x-x1)*(y2-y1)+(y-y1)*(x2-x1) >= 0;
		bool c = -(x-x2)*(y0-y2)+(y-y2)*(x0-x2) >= 0;

		if (a && b && c) {
			sample_buffer[y*width+x] = col;
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
		I iterate over the bounding box around the triangle and determine whether or not the middle of the point is inside
		of the trianle by using the point in triangle method we were taught in lecture. If it is inside I fill
		sample_buffer with its color, and since there is no sample rate yet I don't need to change the offset.

		<h2>Task 3: Transforms</h2>
			I wanted my cube man to dance. This was my attempt at that they're moving their arms back and forth, as if
			they are swaying with the music, I think they'd fit right in on any dance floor.
			<div style="text-align:center ">
		<pre style="margin-right: 100px"><img  src="my_robot_dance.png" width="250px"/><img src="robot_other.png" width="250px"/>
		</pre>

			</div>
		<h2>Task 4: Barycentric coordinates</h2>
			<div style="text-align:center ">
				<img src="gradient_circle.png" width="350px"/>

			</div>
			<p>
			The primary usage of barycentric coordinates is to determine whether a point is located within a
			triangle. Each point on a triangle can be uniquely identified with (where A,B, and C represent the different
			vertices of the triangle).</p>
			<p>
			<div style="text-align:center ">\((x,y)= &alpha;A + &beta;B + &gamma;C \)</div>
			<div style="text-align:center ">\( &alpha; + &beta; + &gamma; = 1 \)</div>
			<p>
			<div style="float:right;width: 50%">
				<img src="interpolated_triangle.png" width="300px"/>

			</div>
			This property lends itself to thinking about the alpha beta and gamma values as a weights, essentially determining the amount of a value being represented
			on a screen due to the point's position on the triangle. If for instance every corner of an equilateral triangle
			represented a different color then a pixel position in the middle of the triangle would have all its weights set to 1/3.
			The figure to the right shows this relationship well. The rgb values all blur into one another as the points traverse towards the center
			and they distill from one another as they approach any vertex. This is due to me using the weights in the code to determine what color I should
			draw the weights.
			This is why if our any of our weight's values are not greater than or equal to zero our point is not located within the triangle.
			In code our barycentric coordinates would look like the figure above. I got these from the lecture slides.
			<p>
			<pre><code>
	float a = -(offset_x-x0)*(y1-y0)+(offset_y-y0)*(x1-x0); // alpha
	float b = -(offset_x-x1)*(y2-y1)+(offset_y-y1)*(x2-x1); // beta
	float c = -(offset_x-x2)*(y0-y2)+(offset_y-y2)*(x0-x2); // gamma

	a = b/(-(x0-x1)*(y2-y1) + (y0-y1)*(x2-x1));
	b = c/(-(x1-x2)*(y0-y2) + (y1-y2)*(x0-x2));
	c = 1-a-b;
			</code></pre>
			</p>



		<h2>Task 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h2>
			2D Pixel sampling for texture mapping is, contrary to what one might expect is the process of mapping a point on a texture onto
			our screen space (u,v) -> (x,y). In order to do this we use barycentric coordinates to determine the weights of the point from the texture
			we are sampling. From there we can sample using either nearest neighbors or bilinear interpolation.

			<p >Nearest neighbors
			sampling requires, as the name suggests, that you simply choose the texel nearest to the point that the texture
			maps onto the screen space. This causes some harsher edges and images that appear less blended together.
			</p>

			<p>Bilinear interpolation takes the coordinate position and makes a copy of it shifted upwards and downwards so that
			the x value remains in the same spot but the y value is now on the same axes as the center of the nearby texels.
			We then linearly interpolate twice for each value and come up with two new texel values that are a mix of the two adjacent
			pixels with weight being determined by our x's proximity to each pixel center. We now have 2 new colors, we do the same
			process once more, only this time we shift across our x-axis and sample based on the distance to the texel centers.

			</div>
			<p>Bilinear interpolation allows for slightly better line blending and there is fewer harsh pixel differences
			as there appear in nearest neighbor interpolation. This means that the lines appear smoother. This trend continues
			onto the super sampled versions which still show, while blurred, this difference. The features
			of the Sather tower are more discernible when looking at them. Bilinear interpolation provides a clearer image
			even at these higher sampling rates.</p>

		<h2>Task 6: "Level Sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h2>
			Using mipmaps we can store successively lower resolution versions of our texture. Level sampling employs these
			smaller versions of our texture in order to avoid aliasing from high frequency details especially if
			what we want to render will be displayed far away from our point of view. These high frequency details become
			more proportional by the level and thus appear less-aliased. If our level were a decimal value, we could do
			trilinear interpolation to discover what the lerp of the bilinear interpolations between two different levels
			would look like. Giving us a pixel with a value somewhere between that of the two texel points.

			<div style="text-align:center ">
				<img src="trilerp.png" width="350px"/>
			</div>

			<p>I calculated level sampling using</p>
			<div style="text-align:center ">\( L = \max\left(\sqrt{\left(\frac{du}{dx}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{dv}{dx}\right)^{2}}, \sqrt{\left(\frac{du}{dy}\right)^{2} + \left(\frac{dv}{dy}\right)^{2}}\right) \)</div>
			<div style="text-align:center ">\( D = \log_{2}(L) \)</div>
			<p>where D is the level. dudx and dvdx were found by taking the vectors difference multiplying it by the
				width/height respectively and so on.
			</p>

			<pre>
	Vector2D duvdx  = sp.p_dx_uv - sp.p_uv;
	Vector2D duvdy = sp.p_dy_uv - sp.p_uv;

	duvdx *= width;
	duvdy *= height;

	float l_x = pow(pow(sp.p_dx_uv.x,2)+pow(sp.p_dx_uv.y,2),0.5);
	float l_y = pow(pow(sp.p_dy_uv.x,2)+pow(sp.p_dy_uv.y,2),0.5);
	float l_max = max(l_x,l_y);
	return log2(l_max);
			</pre>

			<p> Now that I have the appropriate level value I could employ which ever method I wished here are a few examples</p>

			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;">

			</div>
			<p>
				Differences between the forms of bilinear appear more stark at points in the texture that
				are mapped onto the screen space that are warpped and contain a continous pattern, such as this
				wood grain. Changing the level of zoom also affects the amount of aliasing on of the image. Nearest
				is an effective antialiasing method as it accounts for distance of the viewer when determining
				what level to sample from.
			</p>

			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;">
							<img src="zero-level-bi.png" width="300px"/>
							<figcaption> Zero level Bilinear .</figcaption>

							<figcaption>Nearest level Bilinear.</figcaption>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>

			<p>
				Super sampling allows us to change the number of samples we make per pixel. This method is slow, particularly
				using the common method I employed in this assignment, as it requires us traverse over all our texels times the
				sample rate. We also need to use much more memory since we are essentially representing an upscaled image of
				what we want to sample in order to downscale it. This is less memory efficient and increases relative to our
				sample rate. Though it proves very well for antialiasing and reducing jaggies.
			</p>

			<p>
				Pixel sampling allows for things like texture magnification, either using nearest or bilinear, bilinear will
				give better results than nearest, bilinear has normal antialiasing while nearest is bad. Both methods are fast
				requiring only 1 or 4 samples respectively. They don't require any more memory overhead than just the texture.
			</p>
			<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
				<table style="width: 100%; text-align: center; border-collapse: collapse;">
					<tr>
						<td style="text-align: center;">
							<img src="zoomed_bi.png" width="300px"/>
							<figcaption> Zero level bilinear zoomed .</figcaption>
						</td>
						<td style="text-align: center;">
							<img src="zoomed_nn.png" width="300px"/>
							<figcaption>Zero level nearest zoomed.</figcaption>
						</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
			</div>
			<p>
				Level sampling uses the mipmaps to help with antialiasing. If you use an upscaled texture and map
				it onto a space which appears far away you will see aliasing due to the high frequency details. Using a
				mip maps allows you to store lower resolution textures that can be used for these further distances, helping
				with antialiasing. It
				is faster than other methods such as pixel sampling, and is memory efficient when compared to other methods.
				Needing only to store 4/3 as much memory as the original texture uses.
